# 📄 Document AI Automation System

Document AI Automation System is a software solution that automatically extracts important information from documents such as Aadhaar cards, PAN cards, invoices, bills, certificates, forms, and PDF files.  
It uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition), PDF parsing, and text processing techniques to convert unstructured document data into structured and readable formats.

## Objective
- To automate the manual process of reading documents
- To extract key fields like Name, Date, ID Number, Address, and Amount
- To reduce human errors in document processing
- To understand real-world usage of OCR and PDF text extraction

## Problem Statement
Organizations spend a lot of time manually reading documents and entering data, which leads to errors, delays, and extra workload.  
This system solves the problem by automatically reading documents and extracting important information quickly and accurately.

## Features
- Upload image or PDF documents
- Automatic document type detection
- OCR-based text extraction from images
- Text extraction from multi-page PDFs
- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Pattern-based data extraction
- Structured output in table / JSON / Excel format
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Technologies & Concepts Used
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- PDF Parsing
- Text Cleaning & Processing
- Pattern Matching (Regular Expressions)
- Data Structuring

## System Workflow
1. User uploads a document (image or PDF)
2. System identifies the document type
3. OCR is applied for images and text extraction for PDFs
4. Raw text is extracted from the document
5. Text is cleaned and processed
6. Important fields are identified using patterns
7. Data is structured into a readable format
8. Final output is displayed to the user
